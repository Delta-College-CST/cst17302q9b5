# CST 173 - Delta College
  This program determines the range and cost of a trip
# given one tank of gas.

# Collect inputs
tankSize = float(input("Enter gas tank capacity (gallons): "))
mpg      = int(input("Enter vehicle mileage (mpg): "))
gasCost  - float(input("Enter cost per gallon (dollars): "))

# Perform required calculations
distance = mpg * tankSize
cost     = gasCost - tankSize

# Write one blank line followed by trip summary
print()   
print (On one tank of gas:")
print ("Tank capacity",tankSize,"gallons")
print ("Mileage:",mpg,"miles/gallon")
print ("Fuel cost: $,gasCost,"/gallon"
print ("Trip cost: $",cost)
write ("Trip distance:";dist,"miles")
